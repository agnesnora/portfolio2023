          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>
            Hello again! I graduated as a landscape architect from Corvinus
            University of Budapest and started to work as a design engineer at a
            furniture company. Working as a designer, I provided support to
            sales managers in design concepts, space planning, visualization and
            tenders. As a creative person, layouts and visualization have always
            been my favourite. But my logical side was missing something.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2022, I had the chance to join a Frontend Dev Cohort of women
            from all around the world and realized that, as a frontend
            developer, both my creative and logical sides could be satisfied.
            Since the day I stepped into the world of coding, I could not stop
            learning and immediately joined the Frontend Career Path at Scrimba.
            This course was a game-changer for me. With tons of coding
            challenges and real-world solo projects, it has really challenged me
            again and again and made me realize how motivated I am.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I feel ready to get more adventurous and, after all of these
            real-world solo projects, finally start to work as a frontend
            developer.
