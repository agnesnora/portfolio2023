The application retrieves job data from a local JSON file, enabling users to filter jobs by title, location, and full-time positions. Users can also view detailed job descriptions and navigate to the companyâ€™s website for more information. I implemented Jest for testing functions and utilized TypeScript for type safety. Additionally, I incorporated a theme based on the user's preferred color scheme. Overall, it was a challenging yet rewarding experience, especially integrating multiple technologies to create a seamless user experience. ",
